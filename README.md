Hello everyone! 👋

I'm known online as Jerry or mess4na.

I wanted to share with you a small project I've developed: "Osu! Map Pack Downloader".

💿 What is it?
It's an open source web tool that allows you to easily download official osu! beatmap packs in sequence, without having to manually click on each individual link. This tool is especially recommended for beginners who want to download some maps quickly.

🔍 Why did I create it?
After formatting my PC, I wanted to re-download all my favorite beatmap packs, but I realized it was tedious to click on each link individually. So, to practice JavaScript and solve a practical problem, I created this application that I now share with all of you!

✨ How does it work?
Enter the initial and final pack number you want to download
Choose whether to use (.7z) or (.zip) format for packages
Adjust the delay between downloads (higher = gentler on servers)
Click on "Download Map Packs" and the program will automatically download all packages in the specified range
⚙️ Main features:
Automatic format detection: .7z for older packages (<1300), .zip for newer ones
Sequential downloads to not overload the browser or servers
Intuitive interface showing download progress
Configurable delays between downloads to prevent server overload
Completely open source code accessible to anyone
🔒 Important notes:
This is an unofficial tool, developed only for educational purposes and personal use
Requires a valid osu! account to use the downloaded content
Always respect osu!'s terms of service when using beatmaps
